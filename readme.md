# Sentiment Analysis with Pytorch [WIP]

Pytorch Example For Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis with RNN / GRUs / LSTMs on SemEval 2014. Heavily modified from PTB example in official example repository.

Currently we only implemented a baseline LSTM/RNN/GRU model with a linear layer on the *last* output. The sequences are padded with zeros *from the front* so that the last vector is not zero. We pad these in the prepare script using keras pad sequences. Nothing is masked so far and we pad to the max length. 

# Usage

Before running prepare.py you need a folder `../embedding/` one directory higher than project root. (That is where my glove embeddings to avoid copying them in every single project)

## Data Preperation

1) Download glove embeddings from paper. 

```
Jeffrey Pennington, Richard Socher, and Christopher D
Manning. 2014. Glove: Global vectors for word representation.
Proceedings of the Empiricial Methods
in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2014),
12:1532â€“1543.
```

2) Make directory
```
mkdir ../glove_embeddings
```

3) place glove.840B.300d.txt into ../glove_embeddings

```
python prepare.py         # Will take awhile.
```
This should build into `./store` and `./embeddings/`. The former is the environment object that `train.py` reads while the file written into embeddings is just a smaller concised version of glove so  that I can rerun prepare.py fast. 

```
python train.py --cuda --batch-size 20 --rnn_type GRU
```



# Notes

1) It works now! Testing on SemEval (Aspect Category + Restaurants) give about 77-79% accuracy around epoch 20. This is the same result I previously got using TensorFlow. The algorithm constantly predicts the same class (2) for the first 10+ iterations though. 

2) I can't find a way to use clip_norm with optimizers. So it's either you manually clip or you use the optimizer. (For now, I don't clip)

3) LSTM, RNN, GRU are all supported. 

4) It seems like RNNs in pyTorch are batch-minor, i.e, seq length is dim 0 and batch is dim 1. Let's wait for more variable length support.

5) Pretrained embeddings are supported. (I loaded GloVe)
